# File_Organiser

The purpose of this project is to both demonstrate my proficiency in Java and provide a practical software solution. I encountered a common issue where I regularly downloaded files from the Internet, resulting in a clutter of disorganized files on my computer. In order to address this problem, I developed a code that organizes downloaded files. If you've experienced a similar frustration, you're welcome to use this software and even contribute to its development on the repository.
